# DATAVIZ

## Data

The `data` directory contains the cleaned data that is being visualized in our project.

- `all_data.json` contains the combined data of every file in the `raw_data` directory.

- `continents.svg` contains the visual map data of each region

The `rawData` directory contains the original files from which our data was obtained.

The `cleanData.js` script in the `js` directory was used to clean the data contained in the `rawData` directory.
